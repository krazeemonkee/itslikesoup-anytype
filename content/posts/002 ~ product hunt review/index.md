<p style="text-align: justify;">
on <i>july 19, 2023</i>, <b><i>anytype</i></b> officially launched to the public on <b><i>product hunt</i></b> ~ i had already been using the beta version for 5 months at that point, pouring in hundreds of pleasant hours tailoring this <i>silky-software</i> to bend to my exact needs in order for it to fit  my specific system ~•~ the following review i left on launch day + it encapsulates my opinion of it then just as it does now, after many more seasons of use ~ the sheer delight of interacting w/ this program only ever grows w/ time + you are often reminded that the true power of <b><i>anytype</i></b>, the one that sits deep in its core, modularity, or fractalism, or breaking of the whole, down into its parts and connecting them all through <b><i style="color: red;">relations</i></b>, <b><i style="color: yellow;">the mighty</i></b> ~
