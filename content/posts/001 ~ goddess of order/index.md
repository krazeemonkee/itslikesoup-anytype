## the power of order

<p style="padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 0; text-align: justify">order is the soil from which all good things grow üå± it cultivates a controlled environment in which peace + focus can flourish üíê order shifts the entropic state of a system further away from chaos + randomness, granting one the golden opportunity to reclaim the reigns of their destiny + manifest that which they wish ‚ú® in an ordered system, all individual pieces are fully accounted for where the composition, as a whole, can be seen from above, revealing the relations connecting all of its components ~

    <p style="padding: 0; margin: 12px 0 0 0; text-align: justify">long ago, in ancient egypt, no deity was more highly revered by the people + pharaohs than <b>ma'at</b>, <i>goddess of order</i> ‚ú® it was her who awaited them all at the end of the 42 gates of heaven where it is her fairness that grants them access to the after-life ‚ò• she was the personification of truth + justice, a role model of all the principles that mothers would teach their children to embody in order to foster a morally-rich civilization that can earn their right to live eternally üí´ it was this <i>godess of order</i> that maintained the harmon y of the rising sun god ra [god of order] from the rising from the horizon from nun, the chaotic body of water from which ra rises ~ she was the restorer of balance in the fight of chaos [isfret] </p>

## the life changing magic of ...

        <p style="padding: 0; margin: 6px 0 0 0; text-align: justify;"><b>tidying up</b>, <i>as defined by <b>chatgpt</b> is</i> <br>
        <mark style="background-color: red; color: black; padding: 0px; border-radius: 0px;">the act of organizing + cleaning a space to make it neat, orderly, and free from clutter ~ this process typically involves arranging items in their designated places, getting rid of unnecessary items, and generally creating a more visually appealing and functional environment ~ tidying up can be applied to various settings, such as homes, offices, or any other spaces where organization and cleanliness are desired ~ it contributes to a sense of order, promotes efficiency, and can have positive effects on mental well-being</mark></p>

  <div id="bottom2">
    <p style="padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 0; text-align: justify;">if you've never read the book, you may find its title to be overly audacitic in its claim that simply <i>organizing</i> can lead to <i>life-changing magic</i> ~ if you've read the book, however, then you've likely repeatedly felt a sense of this magic vicariously w/out ever tidying up a space ~ <b><i>kondo's</i></b> mere descriptions of chaotic spaces being put in order gives you this palpitable sense of relief, an ease to breath
    sense of ease, a relief of some burdened feeling that gets released in a calming to breath ~ there is indeed a magic that arises when things are organized + in order
