    to the <b><i>egyptian</i></b> mind, <b><i>maat</i></b> bound all things together in an indestructible unity: the universe, the natural world, the state, and the individual were all seen as parts of the wider <span style="color: yellow;">order</span> generated by <b><i style="color: yellow;">maat</i></b>
