## ma'at

Ma'at was the goddess who personified the concepts of truth, justice, harmony, law, morality, balance, and most importantly - order. In paintings, she was depicted as a woman who is either sitting or standing with an ostrich feather on her head and, in some cases, she was depicted with wings

info maat 1 ~
Maat or Ma Ωat (Egyptian: mÍú£Íú•t /Ààmu Ä ïat/, Coptic: ‚≤ô‚≤â‚≤ì)[1] comprised the ancient Egyptian concepts of truth, balance, order, harmony, law, morality, and justice. Ma'at was also the goddess who personified these concepts, and regulated the stars, seasons, and the actions of mortals and the deities who had brought order from chaos at the moment of creation. Her ideological opposite was Isfet (Egyptian jzft), meaning injustice, chaos, violence or to do evil.

live on Maat

To the Egyptian mind, Maat bound all things together in an indestructible unity: the universe, the natural world, the state, and the individual were all seen as parts of the wider order generated by Maat.

When rhetors are attempting to achieve balance in their arguments, they are practicing Maat.

info maat 2 ~
Ma‚Äôat was the goddess of truth, justice, balance, and most importantly - order. In paintings, she was depicted as a woman who is either sitting or standing with an ostrich feather on her head and, in some cases, she was depicted with wings. According to the creation myths, Ma‚Äôat was created when Ra arose from the waters of Nun (chaos). Ma‚Äôat was often considered to be the daughter of Ra and was married to Thoth, god of wisdom.

However, Ma‚Äôat was more than just a goddess to the ancient Egyptians. She represented the crucial concept of how the universe was maintained. The ancient Egyptians believed the universe had an order to it, and it was Ma‚Äôat who kept everything in balance

info maat 3 ~
To the ancient Egyptians, she was not just a goddess, but a power that ensured balance and peace in all realms ‚Äì human, divine, and natural.

Apart from law and religion, Maat‚Äôs beliefs reached personal behavior too. Egyptians believed that following Maat‚Äôs principles would bring blessings and going against them would cause chaos and bad luck. Therefore, people were supposed to act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.

One exciting part of Maat is her bond to nature. The Egyptians saw how the sun rose and set each day, taking note of its dependable pattern that followed the laws of nature. They related this cycle to Maat‚Äôs perpetual presence, strengthening her importance in sustaining global balance.

info set 1 ~
Set (/s…õt/; Egyptological: Sutekh - swt·∫ñ ~ st·∫ñ[a] or Greek: Seth /s…õŒ∏/) is a god of deserts, storms, disorder, violence, and foreigners in ancient Egyptian religion.[6]:‚Ää269‚Ää In Ancient Greek, the god's name is given as Sƒìth (Œ£ŒÆŒ∏). Set had a positive role where he accompanies Ra on his barque to repel Apep, the serpent of Chaos.

info set 2 ~
Set was Ma'at's great antagonist - the agent of chaos, disorder and confusion who threatened the stability and righteousness represented by the goddess of truth and justice. He was her mythological opposite.


chaos and disruption to order were attributed to the god Set's actions and influence in ancient Egyptian theology. He deliberately confounds order to cause isfet.
Isfet simply means the state of chaos, disorder, injustice, violence or moral corruption in ancient Egyptian. It is the condition produced when ma'at is undermined.
Ma'at itself is the central concept referring to the proper order of the universe, justice, truth and harmony in ancient Egypt.
So Ma'at is the abstract ideal of universal harmony and righteous order. When Set works to undermine that order, it produces conditions of isfet - disorder and injustice.
This mirrors the interplay between deities like Osiris (order) and Set (chaos). But while Set is an anthropomorphic god and active agent, isfet is more of a state of affairs or situation, not an entity itself.
So in essence:
Ma'at = order/truth/justice
Set = god of chaos and disorder
Isfet = condition of chaos Set creates
The key is that Set directly causes isfet through his actions. Isfet refers to the chaos itself, while Set is the deity personifying disruption and chaos.

A couple things to try:
Make sure the media query CSS is actually being applied properly in the rendered markdown. You can check by inspecting the elements in dev tools.
Try using a larger min-width in the media query, like 992px:

Copy code
@media (min-width: 992px) {

  #left2, #right2 {
    width: 48%;
  }

}
Confirm the parent #kondo container is displayed as flex:

Copy code
#kondo {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
Try applying widths without media queries first:

Copy code
#left2 {
  width: 48%;
}

#right2 {
  width: 48%;
}
Some markdown parsers may handle media queries differently. Let's narrow down where it's falling apart.
Let me know if any of those tests change the behavior!
