    to the <b><i>egyptian</i></b> mind, <b><i>maat</i></b> bound all things together in an indestructible unity: the universe, the natural world, the state, and the individual were all seen as parts of the wider <span style="color: yellow;">order</span> generated by <b><i style="color: yellow;">maat</i></b>

<p style="padding: 0; margin: 0 0 0 0; text-align: justify;">a truth that's as constant as time is that we, <i>humans</i>,  produce, create + procreate more ñ more w/ each passing year 💫 today, there is more <i>everything</i> than there was in 1924 + many more then than there was a century before that 🗿 as we continue to create + accumulate an endless array of all sorts of things, in both the physical + digital realms, we begin to drown in a sea of overwhelm, <i>silently + slowly</i>, without ever realizing it 😵‍💫</p>
