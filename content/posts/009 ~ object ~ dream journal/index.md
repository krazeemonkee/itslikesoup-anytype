## lucid dreaming

<p style="text-align: justify">a lucid dream is when one gains awareness that they're dreaming ~ in that <i>instant</i>, they are transformed into their very own genie where what they wish, <i>instantly</i> becomes so 🧞‍♂️ how our mind perceives the reality of our dream-world is nearly identical to how it perceives our waking-life <i style="color: #868686;">~ both realities are practically indistinguishable to our senses ~ </i> <span style="color: yellow;">just as we wish to live the life of our <i>dreams</i></span>,<span style="color: red;"> we can equally live <i>a life in our dreams</i></span> ~

<p style="text-align: justify">you often hear that we spend, or what's actually implied, <i style="color: #868686;">waste</i>, a third of our life sleeping ~ instead, if that time can be seen as an extension of life, another realm of living, one where time doesn't quite exist as linearly as it does in this fleshy-world, then that third of time becomes practically infinite time to live endless lives ~

<p style="text-align: justify">the key to gaining access to that lucid world at night is again, to simply gain-awareness that you are dreaming ~ a trick to get you to that realization is to first remember your dreams + a trick to remembering your dreams is to journal them right as you wake up ~

<p style="text-align: justify">as i've learned in life, if something isn't easy, you likely won't do it ~ so, unless you have a truly seamless way to journal everyday, the sparced instances of journalling won't ever materialize into a habbit ~ the process must be seamless, free of daunt + free of resistence ~

009~ object | dream journal


how do you know you're not in a simulation?
how do you know you're not dreaming?

just as you often don't know you're dreaming,
you might not know you're in some sort of simulation

lucid dreams have always fascinated me

few things interest me more in this life than lucid dreaming ~ to gain awareness that you're dreaming, granting you powers of genie where what you wish, becomes so ~

 that is to gain lucidity ~ again, to gain lucidity in a dream, once first realize they are dreaming ~ in order to gain

</i> <span style="color: yellow;">just as we wish to live our <i>dream-life</i></span>,<span style="color: red;"> we can equally live <i>a life in our dreams</i></span> ~
