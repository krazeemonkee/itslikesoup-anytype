<p style="text-align: justify">a system is defined by the set of rules it applies to a given input, yielding a repeatable, expected output ~ on it's own, a system functions as designed, in perpetuity ~ often, it is the operators of a system that don't adhere to its rules + therefore, skew the desired results/output ~
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">it would be of immense benefit for one to view their time + effort spent organizing on <b><i>anytype</i></b> as not just organizing, but rather building a system that organizes ~ it's a subtle distinction but creating a system that continually re/produces a desired result means you only have to build it once and like a factory, it will continue to produce just as it was designed to ~

<p style="text-align: justify">in this series, i will be compiling some of the rules from my system that injects order through consistency as the scale of content grows w/ time ~

the most defining aspect of a system lies in it's systemized

what defines a system is a set of rules

a system is defined by a predefined set of rules, where once adhered to by it's operators, /upheld, upholding

a system is defined by a set of rules, where once followed by it's operators, an expected output can  /upheld, upholding

a system is defined by a known input following set of rules, where once followed by it's operators, an expected output can  /upheld, upholding

 acts on a known input where once followed by it's operators, an expected output can  /upheld, upholding

a system is defined by the set of rules it follows on a known input to produce a consistant, expected output ~ by design, a system is perpetual

it's a subtle distinction but creating a system to produce a result is always a more preferable choice than
