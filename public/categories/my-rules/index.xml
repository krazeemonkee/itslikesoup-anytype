      <description>a system is defined by the set of rules it applies to a given input, yielding a repeatable, expected output ~ on it&#39;s own, a system functions as designed, in perpetuity ~ often, it is the operators of a system that don&#39;t adhere to its rules + therefore, skew the desired results/output ~ it would be of immense benefit for one to view their time + effort spent organizing on anytype as not just organizing, but rather building a system that organizes ~ it&#39;s a subtle distinction but creating a system that continually re/produces a desired result means you only have to build it once and like a factory, it will continue to produce just as it was designed to ~ in this series, i will be compiling some of the rules from my system that injects order through consistency as the scale of content grows w/ time ~ </description>
