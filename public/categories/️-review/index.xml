      <description>on july 19, 2023, anytype officially launched to the public on product hunt ~ i had already been using the beta version for 5 months at that point, pouring in hundreds of pleasant hours tailoring this silky-software to bend to my exact needs in order for it to fit my specific system ~•~ the following review i left on launch day + it encapsulates my opinion of it then just as it does now, after many more seasons of use ~ the sheer delight of interacting w/ this program only ever grows w/ time + you are often reminded that the true power of anytype, the one that sits deep in its core, modularity, or fractalism, or breaking of the whole, down into its parts and connecting them all through relations, the mighty ~ below is my review left on producthunt the day of anytype&amp;rsquo;s public launch &#34;</description>
