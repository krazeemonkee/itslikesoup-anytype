      <description>out of the box, there is no root directory that allows you to view/access all your objects or all objects of a particular type, but you can easily create such an aggregated list referred to in anytype, as a 📊 set what are sets # a 📊 set starts out as an assortment of every single object that&#39;s an offspring of its parental ⚛️ object-type ~ so, w/out applying any filters, a freshly created 📊 set will contain every single sibling-object of their parent&#39;s ⚛️ object-type ~ what are relations # just as every person has an amalgamated identity that&#39;s comprised of many sub-identities such as name, gender [reproductively], nationality, eye-color, etc, every single object created in anytype also has such sub-identities, bits of information/properties relating to an object which are refered to in anytype as 🖇 relations three relations that are identifiers of every single object created in anytype are: 🖇 creation date 🖇 last opened date 🖇 last modified date since these relations are shared by every single object in your anytype space, we can create a 📊 set whose parent is not an ⚛️ object-type but rather a 🖇 relation ~ this means all sibling-objects in the set will be every single object that contains information for that relation, in our case w/ the relations above, since every object is born w/ these native-creations, every single object in our space should appear in these sets ~ create relation sets # follow the guide below to create a set [of relations] for each of the three relations we discussed above: 🖇 creation date 🖇 last opened date 🖇 last modified date 💠 🧵 create 🖇 relation 📊 set navigate to library page via side-panel ⌨️ if configured to open/close on command ⌘ .</description>
