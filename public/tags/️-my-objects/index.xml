      <description>intro ~ lucid dreaming # a lucid dream is when one gains awareness that they are dreaming ~ in that instant, they are transformed into their very own genie where what they wish, instantly becomes so üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è how our mind perceives the reality of our dream-world is nearly identical to how it perceives our waking-life ~ both realities are practically indistinguishable to our senses ~ just as we wish to live the life of our dreams, we can actually live a life in our dreams ~ you often hear that we spend, or what&#39;s actually implied, waste, a third of our life sleeping ~ instead, if that time can be seen as an extension of life, another realm of living, one where time doesn&#39;t quite exist as linearly as it does in this fleshy-world, then that third of time becomes practically infinite time to live endless lives ~ the key to gaining access to that lucid world at night is again, to simply gain-awareness that you are dreaming ~ a trick to get you to that realization is to first remember your dreams + a trick to remembering your dreams is to journal them right as you wake up ~ as i&#39;ve learned in life, if something isn&#39;t easy, you likely won&#39;t do it ~ so, unless you have a truly seamless system to journal the moment you awake while the dream is still freshest in your mind, the sparced instances of journalling won&#39;t ever materialize into a solidified habit ~ the process must be completely free of any daunts or resistence a bed-side notebook + pen could make for a pleasant system if you enjoy physically writing, but unless they&#39;re put in arm&#39;s reach before you go to sleep or you don&#39;t have a bed-side light-source to you see the pages if you wake while it&#39;s still dark, you likely won&#39;t uphold the routine to turn this action into habit ~ a seamless [capturing] system # unless you choose to consciously create a mental separation from your phone at night, since your phone is often in arm&#39;s reach at night + no additional light is needed to write, quickly unlocking your phone w/ one eye open, hard-pressing the anytype app-logo, tapping create note, and 2 seconds later, you have a blank black page to jot down all that you remember you can also create a voice-recording for faster capturing of thoughts/memories that you can then later be transcribed</description>
