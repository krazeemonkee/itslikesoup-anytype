      <description>the power of order # order is the soil from which all good things grow üå± it cultivates a controlled environment in which peace + focus can flourish üíê order shifts the entropic state of a system further away from chaos + randomness, affording one the golden opportunity to reclaim the reigns of their destiny + manifest that which they wish ‚ú® in an ordered system, all individual pieces are fully accounted for where the composition, as a whole, can be seen from above, revealing the relations connecting all of its components ~ ma&amp;rsquo;at, goddess of order # long ago, in ancient egypt, no deity was more highly revered by the people + pharaohs than ma&#39;at, goddess of order ‚ú® it was her who awaited them all at the end of the 42 gates of heaven where it was her fairness that would grant them access to the after-life ‚ò• she was the personification of truth + justice, a role model embodying all the principles that mothers would instill in their children ~ it was this godess of order that maintained the harmon y of the rising sun god ra [god of order] from the rising from the horizon from nun, the chaotic body of water from which ra rises ~ she was the restorer of balance in the fight of chaos [isfret] To the Egyptian mind, Maat bound all things together in an indestructible unity: the universe, the natural world, the state, and the individual were all seen as parts of the wider order generated by Maat.</description>
