      <description>intro ~ lucid dreaming # a lucid dream is when one gains awareness that they are dreaming ~ in that instant, they are transformed into their very own genie where what they wish, instantly becomes so üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è how our mind perceives the reality of our dream-world is nearly identical to how it perceives our waking-life ~ both realities are practically indistinguishable to our senses ~ just as we wish to live the life of our dreams, we can actually live a life in our dreams ~ you often hear that we spend, or what&#39;s actually implied, waste, a third of our life sleeping ~ instead, if that time can be seen as an extension of life, another realm of living, one where time doesn&#39;t quite exist as linearly as it does in this fleshy-world, then that third of time becomes practically infinite time to live endless lives ~ the key to gaining access to that lucid world at night is again, to simply gain-awareness that you are dreaming ~ a trick to get you to that realization is to first remember your dreams + a trick to remembering your dreams is to journal them right as you wake up ~ as i&#39;ve learned in life, if something isn&#39;t easy, you likely won&#39;t do it ~ so, unless you have a truly seamless system to journal the moment you awake while the dream is still freshest in your mind, the sparced instances of journalling won&#39;t ever materialize into a solidified habit ~ the process must be completely free of any daunts or resistence a bed-side notebook + pen could make for a pleasant system if you enjoy physically writing, but unless they&#39;re put in arm&#39;s reach before you go to sleep or you don&#39;t have a bed-side light-source to you see the pages if you wake while it&#39;s still dark, you likely won&#39;t uphold the routine to turn this action into habit ~ a seamless [capturing] system # unless you choose to consciously create a mental separation from your phone at night, since your phone is often in arm&#39;s reach at night + no additional light is needed to write, quickly unlocking your phone w/ one eye open, hard-pressing the anytype app-logo, tapping create note, and 2 seconds later, you have a blank black page to jot down all that you remember you can also create a voice-recording for faster capturing of thoughts/memories that you can then later be transcribed</description>

      <title>the rules of a system</title>

      <guid>https://anytype.itslikesoup.net/posts/rules-of-a-system/</guid>
      <description>a system is defined by the set of rules it applies to a given input, yielding a repeatable, expected output ~ on it&#39;s own, a system functions as designed, in perpetuity ~ often, it is the operators of a system that don&#39;t adhere to its rules + therefore, skew the desired results/output ~ it would be of immense benefit for one to view their time + effort spent organizing on anytype as not just organizing, but rather building a system that organizes ~ it&#39;s a subtle distinction but creating a system that continually re/produces a desired result means you only have to build it once and like a factory, it will continue to produce just as it was designed to ~ in this series, i will be compiling some of the rules from my system that injects order through consistency as the scale of content grows w/ time ~ </description>

      <description>out of the box, there is no root directory that allows you to view/access all your objects or all objects of a particular type, but you can easily create such an aggregated list referred to in anytype, as a üìä set what are sets # a üìä set starts out as an assortment of every single object that&#39;s an offspring of its parental ‚öõÔ∏è object-type ~ so, w/out applying any filters, a freshly created üìä set will contain every single sibling-object of their parent&#39;s ‚öõÔ∏è object-type ~ what are relations # just as every person has an amalgamated identity that&#39;s comprised of many sub-identities such as name, gender [reproductively], nationality, eye-color, etc, every single object created in anytype also has such sub-identities, bits of information/properties relating to an object which are refered to in anytype as üñá relations three relations that are identifiers of every single object created in anytype are: üñá creation date üñá last opened date üñá last modified date since these relations are shared by every single object in your anytype space, we can create a üìä set whose parent is not an ‚öõÔ∏è object-type but rather a üñá relation ~ this means all sibling-objects in the set will be every single object that contains information for that relation, in our case w/ the relations above, since every object is born w/ these native-creations, every single object in our space should appear in these sets ~ create relation sets # follow the guide below to create a set [of relations] for each of the three relations we discussed above: üñá creation date üñá last opened date üñá last modified date üí† üßµ create üñá relation üìä set navigate to library page via side-panel ‚å®Ô∏è if configured to open/close on command ‚åò .</description>

      <title>my review on product hunt</title>

      <description>on july 19, 2023, anytype officially launched to the public on product hunt ~ i had already been using the beta version for 5 months at that point, pouring in hundreds of pleasant hours tailoring this silky-software to bend to my exact needs in order for it to fit my specific system ~‚Ä¢~ the following review i left on launch day + it encapsulates my opinion of it then just as it does now, after many more seasons of use ~ the sheer delight of interacting w/ this program only ever grows w/ time + you are often reminded that the true power of anytype, the one that sits deep in its core, modularity, or fractalism, or breaking of the whole, down into its parts and connecting them all through relations, the mighty ~ below is my review left on producthunt the day of anytype&amp;rsquo;s public launch &#34;</description>

      <description>the power of order # order is the soil from which all good things grow üå± it cultivates a controlled environment in which peace + focus can flourish, granting one the opportunity to spend their attention not on distractions but on building + creating üíê order shifts the entropic state of a system away from chaos + randomness, restoring balance + harmony ‚öñÔ∏è by gaining a greater grasp on the causes/input of a system, one is afforded more predictable, expected effects/outputs üè≠ in an ordered system, all individual pieces are fully accounted for where when viewed from above, the composition reveals the relations of all interconnected components comprising the whole üß© ma&amp;rsquo;at, goddess of order # long ago, in ancient egypt, no deity was more highly revered by the people + pharaohs than ma&#39;at, goddess of order ‚ú® she was said to have been created when ra, sun-god, arose from the waters of nun [chaos, a force they refered to as isfet] üå™ it was thereafter that ma&#39;at continued to perpetuate the very balance of the universe by sustaining the harmony of its revolving planets that revealed the sun in the morning and the moon at night üåõ since maat was the very embodiment of this incredible power, when believers would pray to her, they would more specifically pray that she bestows them with order, as that was the power to balance/battle the chaos/isfet embodied by their primary devil-figure, set, god of chaos üëπ this relationship of order vs chaos was so synonymous w/ good vs evil that maat was often used as a verb, where people would live life in maat/order üåü</description>
