      <description>the power of order # order is the soil from which all good things grow 🌱 it cultivates a controlled environment in which peace + focus can flourish, granting one the opportunity to spend their attention not on distractions but on building + creating 💐 order shifts the entropic state of a system away from chaos + randomness, restoring balance + harmony ⚖️ by gaining a greater grasp on the causes/input of a system, one is afforded more predictable, expected effects/outputs 🏭 in an ordered system, all individual pieces are fully accounted for where when viewed from above, the composition reveals the relations of all interconnected components comprising the whole 🧩 ma&amp;rsquo;at, goddess of order # long ago, in ancient egypt, no deity was more highly revered by the people + pharaohs than ma&#39;at, goddess of order ✨ she was said to have been created when ra, sun-god, arose from the waters of nun [chaos, a force they refered to as isfet] 🌪 it was thereafter that ma&#39;at continued to perpetuate the very balance of the universe by sustaining the harmony of its revolving planets that revealed the sun in the morning and the moon at night 🌛 since maat was the very embodiment of this incredible power, when believers would pray to her, they would more specifically pray that she bestows them with order, as that was the power to balance/battle the chaos/isfet embodied by their primary devil-figure, set, god of chaos 👹 this relationship of order vs chaos was so synonymous w/ good vs evil that maat was often used as a verb, where people would live life in maat/order 🌟</description>
